MYSTRAS_DESC;Exactly 150 years have passed since the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453. After the fall and the death of Konstantinos Paleologos his brothers made a deal with the Sultan and managed to keep their home castle in Mystras and the land gone with it. They agreed to become vassals to the Ottoman Empire and aid to their military operations as allies. In those dark hours the Byzantine Empire was almost forgotten by the greek populations. The vassal state of Mystars was just a castle and not an Empire. At least that was what the Sultan believed. Only the humble family of the old Emperor Konstantinos Paleologos kept considering themselves heirs to the throne of Constantinople. And this only in their private conversations. Nevertheless, through rennaissance and enlighment years that followed, they managed to keep their byzantine identity and reinforce the byzantine identity of their people. But the Turks have reached their limit. They can go only down from now on. The Austrians backed by the armies of the Great Spanish Empire have already started to reclaim their territories in central Europe. Now Paleologoi family are waiting for the right moment....!!;X;;

AMWI_NAME;American Revolution;x;;
BM_ENLIGHTDESC;In Britain, the childless death of Queen Elizabeth and ascension of James VI of Scotland to the English throne has united the crowns of Britain, laying the foundations for what would become the United Kindom of Great Britain. On the continent ceaseless religious and imperial conflicts rage on even as the Turks press against the very gates of Vienna. For the first time in history European Wars are being carried overseas as the Spanish, French, English and Dutch all vie to become rulers of the New World and its boundless riches. Meanwhile, the Italian Renaissance, pushed North and bolstered by the Protestant reformation, has spawned a new way of thinking in Northern Europe, resulting in the Enlightenment. New ways to live, rule and wage war are being discovered daily by the greatest minds in history. This is an age of glory, and now, more than ever, fortune favours the bold.;x;;
BM_EMPDESC;European nations have fought each others for 14 long years in the War of the Spanish Succession. Now as the armies and delegations return home the true extent of the Imperial ambitions Europe has pursued for the last hundred years is revealed. Britain, united under a single flag since 1707, has grown from a European country with moderate sway to a global Empire controlling a great percentage of the world's trade and, at the expense of much of Europe, even access to the Mediterranean. Its Thirteen American Colonies, arguably its most populous Imperial territories, dominate the Eastern shores of the North American continent and contribute vastly to Britain's wealth. Indeed, the Atlantic Triangle, which sees traders acquire slaves in Africa for use in American plantations, the output of which is then shipped to British ports like Liverpool, is proving immensely profitable. And yet for all its wealth, Britain still does not reign supreme. French posessions extend from Canada all the way south to New Orleans, and the Spanish and Portuguese have practically divided the remainder of the new world between themselves. This competition and the fact that new territories are being discovered and colonised every day is sure to drive these Imperial powers to war once again. And to the victor goes the spoils.;x;;
BM_NAPODESC;Europe is in turmoil. The fire of liberalism which had overturned a thousand years of French monarchy has consumed its own master. The French republic, as a result of war and civil disorder, was in total chaos. Facing bankruptcy, enemies in every direction and a weak, unpopular government at home, France was ripe for the taking for any ambitious revolutionary. This came in the form of Napoleon Bonaparte, a fairly competent general who, in 1799, returned from his Egyptian campaign to a hero's welcome in Paris. He quickly set about overthrowing the government and established himself as dictator. Whilst no longer a republic, France did not rid itself of its liberal pretences. To the contrary, under Napoleon the French army is now more determined, and more capable, than ever to overthrow what are considered by its revolutionaries to be outdated tyrannical governments across Europe. The stage is set for the Napoleonic wars.;x;;
AMWI_DESC;The year is 1764. Following the Seven Years' War which has ended just a year ago with the Treaty of Paris, Britain has gained control of much of North America from its French and Spanish rivals. Despite this victory for the Empire there is a growing discontent amongst the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies. For all their services to the British crown during the French and Indian Wars and before it seems like they are only ever rewarded with ever-increasing contempt and legal restrictions. While not all share this feeling, for many freeborn Americans raised on the British Enlightenment values there is a creeping contradition between the liberal ideals preached in Britain and the policies applied in the colonies. For others, talk of abolitionism within England's high society and the prospect of peace with native Americans seem to threaten the way of life in the American South and the frontier. The idea that the colonies, indeed that Americans, could do much better on their own is starting to take hold even amongst the more privileged in American society. Now whether that idea turns into reality, is forgotten, or is used to other ends, is all up to you.;x;;
WW1_NAME;The Great War;x;;
WW1_DESC;The state of peace in Europe today is fragile. The great powers of 1910 - France, Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia, have arranged themselves in a system of alliances to preserve the balance of power of the continent. Germany's power has also been growing greatly since their unification only a few decades prior, and the rapid development of this upstart power has done well to panic her competetors. Meanwhile, in the Balkan states, Austria-Hungary, Serbia, and yet other nations compete aggressively for dominance of the region. It is only a matter of time before Europe falls into the darkness of war, and we must prepare.;x;;
